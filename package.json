  "description": "Image Search Abstraction Layer Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10 and browse recent search queries like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/. Then deploy it to Heroku. Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project: User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string. User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL. User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.",
